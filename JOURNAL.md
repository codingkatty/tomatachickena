## Day 1
I was thinking really hard and I got an idea- so its the Tomata Chickena, a cute pet that would increase productivity. Well, lets just say I procrastinate a bit *too* much and its a bit of an issue, and I kind of ignore to-do lists. So, I tried to have virtual pets! They worked for a bit... but not much, because I don't get emotionally attached to something.. virtual. [vine boom]

wut if it was physical, just like a pet? not just any pet, one that could potentially... live forever!

So, this chicken changes it all! Its a <sub>(pomodoro)</sub>tomato <sub>(rooster)</sub>chicken, and its a clock! (just like how those chicken wake you up in the morning), but this one will scream on top of its lungs (or speaker) to make you do your work!! :D Here's a thing I drew while brainstorming

### Brainstorm
As I think, many ideas rush in my brain, so, here are some functions I'm going to add! (hopefully)

- able to mount onto a pegboard
- able to clip onto my bed railing
- silent mode (uses headphones so doesn't disturb people)
- a screen; shows what work to do
- connects to computer to add to-dos or track wakatime maybe
- gotta do work to feed chicken
- voice chicken, and maybe beg friends with some ramen for other random chicken sounds... (or duck)
- pomodoro timer :D
- has a motor and could swing itself
- some buttons to interact with screen
- very, very loud speaker to play the noise!! :D

Anddd here's a little drawing of how I would make the chicken... next time, imma continue more!! byee
