## Day 1
I was thinking really hard and I got an idea- so its the Tomata Chickena, a cute pet that would increase productivity. Well, lets just say I procrastinate a bit *too* much and its a bit of an issue, and I kind of ignore to-do lists. So, I tried to have virtual pets! They worked for a bit... but not much, because I don't get emotionally attached to something.. virtual. [vine boom]

wut if it was physical, just like a pet? not just any pet, one that could potentially... live forever!

So, this chicken changes it all! Its a <sub>(pomodoro)</sub>tomato <sub>(rooster)</sub>chicken, and its a clock! (just like how those chicken wake you up in the morning), but this one will scream on top of its lungs (or speaker) to make you do your work!! :D Here's a thing I drew while brainstorming

### Brainstorm
As I think, many ideas rush in my brain, so, here are some functions I'm going to add! (hopefully)

- able to mount onto a pegboard
- able to clip onto my bed railing
- silent mode (uses headphones so doesn't disturb people)
- a screen; shows what work to do
- connects to computer to add to-dos or track wakatime maybe
- gotta do work to feed chicken
- voice chicken, and maybe beg friends with some ramen for other random chicken sounds... (or duck)
- pomodoro timer :D
- has a motor and could swing itself
- some buttons to interact with screen
- very, very loud speaker to play the noise!! :D

Anddd here's a little drawing of how I would make the chicken... next time, imma continue more!! byee

[end of day 1 <3]

## Day 2
Weeeel, I've been procrastinating a bit lately. I decided that enough is enough and today, I will start with the bom, pcb, etc. I did some brainstorming on paper and I am going to use a Raspberry Pi Zero 2w I got from high seas! (:D) and here's a little pic of the chicken i did in figma! I will refer to this for future things. The idea is to make the back acrylic and use some colorful jumper wires for some of the parts!!

### Components and link
I'm going to find components on Cytron for now, it will be expensive but its easy to find, and I will find the exact same stuff on Taobao for cheaper :3

- Speaker: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1314
- Amplifier: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3006
- LED thing: https://my.cytron.io/p-1w-high-power-led-beads-6000k-cool-white
- Screen (oled?): -
- Joystick: https://my.cytron.io/p-2-axis-analog-and-button-ps2-joystick-module
- Button: (maybe the one from solder but make a cap and use springs?)
- Servo: (already owned)
- Touch sensor: (owned)
- Toggle switch?: https://my.cytron.io/p-hl8211-push-to-on-button
- Battery: https://my.cytron.io/p-3.7v-5000mah-li-ion-battery-with-jst-ph2.0
- Charge controller: https://my.cytron.io/p-lithium-battery-tp4056-1a-usb-c-charger-with-protection

This would wrap up for day 2, I spent ~1 hour researching and drawing the thing! There's also a bit ~1 hour thinking these days but might not count that...

## Day 3
ahhh I've been procrastinating (and working on another project maybe), finally tho I've decided to start and make a schematic...

tbh idk why i need a pcb... it would be cool tho.. but I feel like i dont need to sometimes, everything can be connected with a jumper wire. i figured that it would make this look cool and i'll try and keep it under 100mmx100mm so that its cheap. (wip) i also switched the button to a key
